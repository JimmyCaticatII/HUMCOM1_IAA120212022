                    <p> Dragonborn, also referred to as Dovahkiin in the Dragon Language, are individuals with the body of a mortal, 
                        but the blood and soul of a Dragon. Some believe that a Dragonborn appears on the world in times of great need
                        by the command of the Gods.</p>

                    <p style="font-style: italic;">"Dragons have the inborn ability to learn and project the their Voice. Dragons also are able to absorb the power 
                        of their slain brethren. A few mortals are born with similar abilities, wether a gift or a curse has been a 
                        matter of debate through centuries. What you have already learned in a few days took even the most gifted of us 
                        years to achieve. Some beleive that Dragonborns are sent into the world by the gods, at times of great need."
                        -Arngeir, Leader of the Greybeards</p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 40pt;"> By Nord tradition, a Dragonborn represents what a Nord should strive to be. The Nords believe a Dragonborn 
                        represent the end of all Skyrim's foes. Nord tales likewise tell of Dragonborn of old who were great and powerful 
                        Dragonslayers, a beleif which the Blades of the late Fourth Era also believe to be the reason why the old Akaviri 
                        Dragonguard came to serve the Dragonborn.</p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 40pt;">It is unknown as to how a Dragonborn is chosen. The various dynasties of Dragonborn Emperors led to a common beleif 
                        that the Dragon blood is hereditary, though since it is a blessing of Akatosh himself it cannot be known how or why 
                        it is bestowed. It is unkown if the Dragonborn Emperors were Dragonborn, and thus able to wear the Amulet of Kings 
                        and light the Dragonfires, or if these acts were the sign of Akatosh's blessings for these Dragonborns.</p>
                    <h3 style="color: cornflowerblue;">The Greybeards</h3>
                    <p style="text-indent: 40pt;"> After slaying a Dragon, and learning the meaning of a Word of Power, the Greybeards are able to sense this and summon 
                        the Dragonborn. Should a Dragonborn choose to answer the summons of the Greybeards, they are first tested to see if 
                        they truly posses the Thu'um. A Dragonborn has the inborn ability to both learn and master a new Word of Power far 
                        quicker than a normal mortal can, as regular mortals usually need years of training to learn a Word of Power. Due to 
                        the inborn ability of Dragonborns to use the Thu'umm the Greybeards seek to guide them in the proper usage of their 
                        power.</p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 40pt;"> In order to truly show a Dragonborn's abilities, the Greybeards send them off to retrieve the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller, 
                        the found of the Greybeards. Upon retrieving the Horn and returning it, the Greybeards formally name the Dragonborn 
                        "Ysmir", the "Dragon of the North", to declare the Dragonborn has accepted their guidance.</p>

                    <h3 id="MEra" style="color: burlywood; text-indent: 20pt;">Merethic Era</h3>
                    <p style="text-indent: 40pt;"> Miraak, who lived during the Dragon War of the Merethic Era, became known as the First Dragonborn. The Three Tongues, Hakon
                        One-Eye, Gormliath Golden-Hilt, and Felldir the Old, who led the charge against Alduin had asked Miraak for his aid, though 
                        Miraak denied, having other plans. Miraak would eventually be defeated in combat by Vahlok the Jailor, though saved by Hermaeus Mora.00000</p>

                    <h3 id="FEra" style="color: burlywood; text-indent: 20pt;">First Era</h3>
                    <p style="text-indent: 40pt;"> During the First Era, the Nedic Slave rebellion in Cyrodiil against the Ayleids would take place, being led by Slave Queen Alessia. Alessia, 
                        being a Dragonborn, was gifted the Amulet of Kings by Akatosh, which would be used to light the Dragonfires and keep the armies of Oblivion 
                        at bay. Alessia's Line would continue with more Dragonborn Emperors and Empresses, until their deaths.</p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 40pt;"> In 1E 2703, the Akaviri attempted an invasion of Tamriel, which would eventually be foiled by the efforts of Reman Cyrodiil. The exact nature 
                        of defeat of the Akaviri is unknown, though it is known that they were not seeking for combat with Reman, but were instead searching for him, 
                        as he was a Dragonborn. Under Reman Cyrodiil, the Dragon blood officially became part of becoming a legitimate Emperor, as he included the rituals 
                        gears to the Amulet of Kings, and the lighting of the Dragonfires, in the rites of becoming and Emperor. His dysnasty would continue until the 
                        death of Juliek Cyrodiil during the Four Score War.</p>

            <article>
                    <h3 id="SEra" style="color: burlywood; text-indent: 20pt;">Second Era</h3>
                    <p style="text-indent: 40pt;"> As of 2E 579, it had been years since the last Dragonborn Emperor had ruled. Following Varen Aquilarios successful rebellion against the Longhouse 
                        Emperors, he aimed to legitimize his rule through lighting the Dragonfires. Varen was not a Dragonborn, and was convinced by Mannimarco to participate 
                        in the ritual which would end up being a trick. Instead of becoming a Dragonborn, Varen and his companions were forced to the ground, while Mannimarco 
                        corrupted the power of the Amulet of Kings to trigger the Soulburst, and eventually Planemeld, until it was stopped by the Vestige.</p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 40pt;"> After Kaalgrontiid and his kin were freed from the Halls of Colossus, one such dragon named Sahtronax was captured by the Hollowfang Clan of vampires 
                        with the assistance of the rogue Dragonguard Grundwulf, who then proceeded to drink his blood believing it would make him a Dragonborn and with that power 
                        unite the fractured Empire once more. Though the ritual granted him extraordinary abilities, he was slain shortly afterward.</p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 40pt;"> Years later, in 2E 828m another Dragonborn would be placed on the world. This Dragonborn being Tiber Septim. Tiber Septim would learn the Thu'um from Wulfharth, 
                        and meet the Greybeards shortly after, who told him he was destined to unite Tamriel. During his campaigns in Cyrodiil, he would find the Amulet of Kings 
                        during the Battle of Sancre Tor against the Nord-Breton Alliance. After having become Emperor, Tiber Septim declared the start of the Third Era.</p>

                    <h3 id="TEra" style="color: burlywood; text-indent: 20pt;">Third Era</h3>
                    <p style="text-indent: 40pt;"> Tiber Septim's dynas of Dragonborn Emperors would continue to rule the Third Empire until the Oblivion Crisis. Under the reign of Emperor Uriel Septim VII, the 
                        Mythic Dawn attempted to slay the Dragonborn Emperors and thus provide Mehrunes Dagon with the means to cross over into Tamriel. Uriel Septim and his three sons 
                        were assassinated, with only his bastard son, Martin Septim having survived. The leader of the Mythic Dawn cult, Mankar Camoran, was likewises a Dragonborn, able 
                        to speak fire and wear the Amulet of Kings. Mankar would eventually be slain in his Paradise, whereas Martin Septim would meet his end after he destroyed the 
                        Amulet of Kings in order to banish Mehrunes Dagon.</p>

                    <h3 id="FoEra" style="color: burlywood; text-indent: 20pt;">Fourth Era</h3>
                    <p style="text-indent: 40pt;"> During the 4E 201, the prophecy of the Last Dragonborn would come to pass. Alduin, who had been banished from Tamriel since the Merethic Era by an Elder Scroll, 
                        returned to the land, indirectly helping the Last Dragonborn to escape an Imperial execution at Helgen by destroying the town. The Last Dragonborn would learn 
                        of his nature while aiding the city of Whiterun by slaying the Dragon Mirmulnir at the Western Watchtower of Whiterun. Upon defeating the Dragon, the Dragonborn 
                        gained its soul, and through the Word of Power that the Dragonborn had learned previously in a mission of the court wizard, was able to use the Thu'um.</p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 40pt;"> After learning Dragonrend, the Last Dragonborn was able to face off against Alduin to atop the Throat of the World, winning a minor victory against the World-Eater, 
                        though Alduin did escape to Sovngarde. The Dragonborn would give chase, and through the help of Odahviing, they would gain access to Skuldafn and its portal to Sovngarde. 
                        In Sovngarde, the Last Dragonborn would meet up with the three Nord Tongues of Old, Gormliath, Hakon, and Felldir, and together they faced off against Alduin, 
                        defeating him in combat. It is unknown if Alduin was truly slain, as in contrast to regular Dragons, his soul was not absorbed. The leader of the Greybeards, 
                        Arngeir, believed that it may have been possible that he could return to fulfill his true destiny, though that was for the gods to decide.</p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 40pt;">The First Dragonborn, Miraak, had also gained more power since his defeat by Vahlok. Upon learning of the Last Dragonborn, he had sent out cultists with the orders 
                        to defeat the Dragonborn. The Last Dragonborn would travel to Solstheim, where the cultists had originated, in order to find the origin of the cultists. Here, he 
                        would discover that Miraak had corrupted the All-Maker Stones in order to increase his power for his planned return. During his quest to stop Miraak, Miraak held 
                        the power to transport the Last Dragonborn every time he would slew a Dragon, and steal the Dragon's soul before the Last Dragonborn could absorb it. With the aid 
                        of Hermaeus Mora, the Last Dragonborn would learn the necessary powers required to defeat Miraak, primarily the Bend Will Thu'um. The Last Dragonborn would travel 
                        to Apocrypha one last time to face Miraak in combat. After a long battle, Hermaeus Mora ended the conflict by slaying Miraak for his treachery, and naming the Last Dragonborn 
                        his champion. This was because Hermaeus Mora did not desire Miraak to be set free from his direct control, and instead wanted a more loyal servant.</p>
