                    <p class="text">Early Māori adapted the tropically based east Polynesian culture in line with the challenges associated with a larger and more diverse environment, eventually developing their own distinctive culture. Social organization was largely communal with families (whānau), subtribes (hapū) and tribes (iwi) ruled by a chief (rangatira), whose position was subject to the community's approval. The British and Irish immigrants brought aspects of their own culture to New Zealand and also influenced Māori culture, particularly with the introduction of Christianity. However, Māori still regard their allegiance to tribal groups as a vital part of their identity, and Māori kinship roles resemble those of other Polynesian peoples. More recently, American, Australian, Asian and other European cultures have exerted influence on New Zealand. Non-Māori Polynesian cultures are also apparent, with Pasifika, the world's largest Polynesian festival, now an annual event in Auckland.</p>

                    <p class="text">Though the relations between the Indigenous peoples and Western settlers have varied throughout its history and have been strained at times, New Zealand is founded on the principles of equality and classlessness. Although the earlier culture of the Māori displayed social stratification with three different hierarchies of belonging in their society, the classes relatively disappeared with influence and interaction with other cultures. New Zealanders, also called Kiwis, are social people who believe in basic politeness and hospitality to all. They value aspects such as personal distance during communication, greeting, and have defined expectations on showing affection in public. For instance, during communication, too much eye contact and closeness translate to the invasion of personal space. Greetings are also an important part of the social fabric of New Zealand with parties acknowledging each other with a simple “Good day!”.</p>

                    <p class="text">The cuisine of the Māori people includes sweet potatoes, fern roots, birds, and fish prepared into various meals with earthen ovens, roasting and steaming over natural hot springs and pools. The influences of the European culinary cultures on the Māori led to the adoption of pork and potatoes in the Māori diet. The Pakeha people, a word used to refer to light-skinned Māori or to the Western colonizers, brought their native culinary tradition into New Zealand including their high consumption of red meat and sweet foods. The evolution of the country's cuisine from influences of local and international cultures has led to the emergence of new cuisines and the recreation of former ones. Food tourism has also grown, with tourists eager to partake in unique cuisines and more restaurants incorporating a variety of local and ethnic foods into their menus. Increased awareness of healthy eating has also played a significant role in the production and preparation of food in the country with most people opting for healthier choices.</p>

                    <p class="text">Clothing is an essential part of the identity of New Zealanders. While most of the fashion is from Western culture, subtle influences of other cultures, particularly Māori, can be found in the dress and style of clothing. Both the Māori and the Pakeha borrowed clothing styles and pattern designs from each other. Today, the Māori will often wear their traditional clothing during cultural festivals, and their daily wear is primarily casual and Western in style. Generally, New Zealanders dress in a smart-casual style when out for social events.</p>

                    <p class="text">Music and dance are some of the aspects that are central to any culture. The music and dance in the New Zealandic culture draw its influences from genres such as jazz, pop, hip-hop, or rock and roll. However, the music has a unique New Zealand twist from the incorporation of Māori singing traditions, dances and musical instruments. Traditional Māori music featured monotonal and harmonic signing, usually by a group of singers. Later on, the music developed through the adoption of European styles and instruments leading to the rise of contemporary Māori music. Dance styles of New Zealand descend from influences of the Pacific, Asian, and European cultures. Cultural dances and music are often seen at festivals and cultural events in New Zealand. The most famous dance is the Pacific dance, a part of the Pasifika festival. The traditional Māori dance, the Haka, has also gained prominence in New Zealand. Other dances in New Zealand include the Irish dance, Morris dance, Legong, Chinese lion and dragon dances, and Bharata Natyam.</p>

                    <p class="text">The traditional Māori storytelling is primarily oral. During the pre-European era, oral traditions were the common method of transmission of their cultural traditions, beliefs, and practices. The major literature developed in New Zealand for a long time showed the dominance of European influence. Very few Māori engaged in literary production, with that trend changing only recently. The Māori flourished in the performing arts such as traditional dances and songs. New Zealand is home to numerous museums and galleries that contain relics of the Māori arts including sculptures, woven items, and carvings made from various materials. Some individuals, organizations and the government provide funds towards the promotion and revival of traditional arts.</p>

                    <p class="text">Sports are important in the culture of New Zealand. Popular sports include rugby, cricket, football, netball, golf, basketball, hockey, tennis, and water sports such as sailing and surfing. New Zealand also uses its winter season for sporting activities such as skiing and snowboarding. New Zealand participates in both local and international competitions and has a prominent national rugby team commonly known as the All Blacks. Athletic activities in New Zealand are also vital, especially track and field events including racing, boxing, and cycling. Most of the sporting activities developed from influences of British and Western cultures and grew from recreation activities to competitive and professional ones. New Zealand also prides itself on the invention of bungee jumping and zorbing, both of which are tourist attractions of New Zealand.</p>
