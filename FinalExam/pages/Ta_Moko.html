                    <p class="text">Ta Moko or Maori tattoo is a traditional form of tattooing that was originally done on the face and body. It was a core component of the Maori culture and a physical expression of obligation and admiration. It portrayed the person's lineage, knowledge, and social standing. In recent decades, the significance of ta moko has risen slowly as a practice to revive the cultural identity of the Maori. Men adorn their face, arms, thighs, and buttocks with Maori tattoos. Women get these designs on their chin, throat, forehead, nostrils, and lips. Most ta moko symbols have a specific meaning, and the designs made using these symbols usually tell a story. </p>
