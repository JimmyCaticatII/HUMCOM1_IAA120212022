                    <p> Two hundred years have passed since the events of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, 
                        and it is now 4E 201. The High King of Skyrim has been killed, and the threat of 
                        Civil War looms over the land of Skyrim; One side wishes to secede from the weakened 
                        Third Empire, while the other wishes to remain a part of it. To make matters worse, 
                        this schism is the final event in a prophecy foretold by the Elder Scrolls that will 
                        lead to the return of the dragons under Alduin, the Nordic god of destruction. </p>

                    <h3><mark class="titles">Cthulhu</mark></h3>
                    <h4>Image by: Phoenix Blood</h4>
                    <p> Cthulhu (ka-THOO-loo) is a fictional god-like monstrosity invented by 20th-century 
                        horror writer H.P. Lovecraft. First appearing in Lovecraft's short story "The Call of Cthulhu", 
                        this creature is a cosmic being of terrifying power, described as being a manifestation 
                        of chaos and destruction. Cthulhu's appearance is that of a colossal humanoid entity 
                        possessing both anthropoidic and cephalopodic qualities. The most defining feature of Cthulhu is its head, which closely 
                        resembles an octopus. The head is mostly a large, bulbous, pulsating sac, and numerous 
                        writhing tentacles sprout from where one would expect a mouth to be.</p>
